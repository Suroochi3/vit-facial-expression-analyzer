# ðŸŽ­ ViT-Based Facial Expression Recognition

This repository contains a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model trained to detect facial expressions and emotional states. It is **specifically developed for the AI Powered Smart Cognitive Tracker** â€” a multimodal AI system designed to identify early signs of mental health issues in adolescents.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Context

Facial expressions often reveal subtle emotional and psychological states such as stress, sadness, anxiety, or happiness. In this project, the **ViT model** plays a critical role in analyzing visual emotional cues from facial images, contributing to a larger multimodal mental health analysis system.
