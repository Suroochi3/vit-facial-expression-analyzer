# ðŸŽ­ ViT-Based Facial Expression Recognition

This repository contains a Vision Transformer (ViT) model implementation for recognizing facial emotions based on image data. It is part of the **AI Powered Smart Cognitive Tracker** project â€” an AI system to detect early signs of mental health challenges using multimodal data.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Facial expressions often reveal emotional states such as sadness, anxiety, stress, or happiness. This model analyzes facial images and classifies the emotion using a pretrained **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model.
